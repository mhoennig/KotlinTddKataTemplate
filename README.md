# Tic Tac Toe Code Katas with Kotlin/JVM using JUnit5-Jupiter, AssertK and MockK

This branch demonstrates a Tic Tac Toe Code Kata with separate commit for each step:
- make it fail (red)
- make it pass (green)
- make it clean (still green)

It contains some example test methods demonstrating the test library features.
One of these would deliberately fail for demonstration purposes, but is disabled.
