# Code Katas with Kotlin/JVM using JUnit5-Jupiter, AssertK and MockK

The master branch is a template for Code Katas with Kotlin.

It contains some example test methods demonstrating the test library features.
One of these would deliberately fail for demonstration purposes, but is disabled.

In branches I am adding concrete Katas with this setup:

See separate commits to see my steps.
