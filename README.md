# Tic Tac Toe Code Kata with Kotlin/JVM using JUnit5-Jupiter and AssertK

This branch demonstrates a Tic Tac Toe Code Kata with separate commit for each step:
- make it fail (red)
- make it pass (green)
- make it clean (still green)

That means, for some of the commits the tests are deliberately failing.
